							An exceptional traditional Belgravia Grade II listed house built in 1837 that combines features rarely found all in the same home. Particularly wide at 30ft with 3 windows it offers rooms of grand proportions perfectly suited for entertainment and modern living. South facing garden, underground parking for 2 cars, private street direct drive-in entrance and lift are just some of the reasons it would be hard to find another property like this in the heart of London’s Belgravia neighbourhood.
